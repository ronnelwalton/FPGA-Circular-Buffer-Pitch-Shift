# FPGA-Circular-Buffer-Pitch-Shift
Adjustable Pitch Shift for DE-10 Nano. Uses circular buffer to adjust the pitch of incoming sound through a daughter board mounted onto the DE-10 Nano. 

Includes Linux OS for DE-10 Nano with auto-start of the kernel, and Linux kernel to run the hardware.
Linux Kernel was generated through Quartus and the pitch shift model was generated through Simulink of MatLab.
